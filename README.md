Datapack Toolkit is an easy-to-use Minecraft worldgen datapack configuration tool.

This version is early in development, and currently only supports custom datapack configuration screens.

Also planned to support:

- Picking biome definition providers from a set of packs
- Editing structure set placement

This web version replaces the previous [datapack toolkit](https://github.com/everloste/DatapackToolkit).
